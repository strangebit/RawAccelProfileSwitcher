# Changelog


## v1.0.1

* Added a `--delete` parameter to delete saved profiles. Be sure that
    this is what you want to do before using this feature, as RawAccel
    Profile Switcher will NOT ask for any confirmation before doing this.
* Allow optional parameters to be specified before the profile name.
    Previously, `--save`, `--gui`, etc. could only come after the
    specified profile name. Now typing `rawaccel-switch --gui quake`
    will also work as expected.
* Updated the [Guide](guide.md) to reflect the above changes.


## v1.0.0

* Initial release.
