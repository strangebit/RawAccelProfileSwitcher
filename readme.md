# RawAccel Profile Switcher for the CLI (v1.0.4)

RawAccel Profile Switcher is a simple Batch script that allows you
to quickly save and switch between different [RawAccel](https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel)
settings from the Command-Line Interface (CLI), including the Run
dialog (by pressing WinKey + R).

To save your current RawAccel settings, press WinKey + R, type in
`rawaccel-switch --save quake`, and then hit ENTER. To restore these
settings later, just type `rawaccel-switch quake`. When you are done
playing Quake, you could type in `rawaccel-switch windows` to switch
back to your preferred Windows settings (assuming you already have a
previously-saved profile under that name).

If you prefer, you can also use the simpler `rawaccel` command, rather
than the more cumbersome `rawaccel-switch` command, by slightly tweaking
the installation process. This is how I personally use it, but to set
it up in this way you will also be required to edit the Batch script
yourself to point to your particular RawAccel program directory. Don't
worry, this is relatively easy to do. Detailed instructions are found
at the [bottom of the Guide](rawaccel-switch-doc/guide.md#how-to-install-as-rawaccel-rather-than-rawaccel-switch).

## Using RawAccel Profile Switcher

    rawaccel-switch [--save | --delete | --gui | --writer] <profile-name>
    rawaccel-switch --list [<profile-name-filter>]
    rawaccel-switch --help

When using the `--save` option, your current RawAccel settings will be
saved into the specified profile. If a profile already exists under
that name, it will overwrite the profile without asking for
confirmation. Be sure that this is what you want to do before using
this option.

When using the `--delete` option, this will cause the specified
previously-saved profile to be deleted so that it is no longer
accessible to RawAccel Profile Switcher. This will occur without
asking for confirmation, so be sure that this is what you want to do
before using this option.

When using `rawaccel-switch` without any of the options, this will simply
restore the specified profile and apply it to your current RawAccel
settings. For example, `rawaccel-switch windows` will restore and apply
the `windows` profile to your current RawAccel settings.

When restoring a saved profile, use the `--gui` or `--writer` options
if you want to enforce that the RawAccel GUI application is launched,
or that RawAccel's `writer.exe` is used. For more information on using
these options, see the section of the Guide entitled
[Using the gui and writer options](rawaccel-switch-doc/guide.md#using-the-gui-and-writer-options).

Using the `--list` option will display a list of all saved profiles by
their profile names. You can also specify a filter, which can include
wildcards. For example, `rawaccel-switch --list fk2_*` will display a
list of all saved profiles that have names prefixed with `fk2_`.

The `--help` option will display the help text.

## The `Apply Settings.json On GUI Startup` option is recommended

Because of the way RawAccel Profile Switcher sometimes uses the
RawAccel GUI application to restore its settings, it is strongly
recommended that you enable the `Advanced` âžž `Apply Settings.json On GUI Startup`
option within the GUI application. This option is enabled by default
anyway, so it is unlikely that you will need to change anything.

You can also enable this option using a text editor by opening up
RawAccel's `.config` file and making sure the `AutoWriteToDriverOnStartup`
field is set to `true`.

Without this option being enabled, whenever the RawAccel GUI
application is launched by RawAccel Profile Switcher, it will not apply
the restored settings to the RawAccel driver, nor will it even display
the restored settings within the GUI application. This is probably not
the behaviour that you want.

You can get away with not enabling this option if you intend to only
ever use the `--writer` option when restoring a saved profile.
